# Cat or dog?
## Image classification with Convolutional Neural Nets (CNN)

Using the same dataset as in the [logistic regression lab](https://github.com/mgbarsky/ml_cats_dogs_lab), build a classifier that uses CNN to classify images into two classes: cats or dogs.  

You can find all the details about building CNN using `keras.layers` in the following [blog](https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/convolutional-neural-network-cnn-tutorial).
